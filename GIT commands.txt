Follow this git commands

1.first tell git who you are
git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"
git config --global user.email sam@example.com

2.go to folder which you want to push that to repo

3.git init in that path

4. git add * (adds all files in that path) and stages that

5. git commit  -m "committing"   - commits the files in above provided path

6. git remote add origin https://github.com/vamshiosuru/Udemy-API.git

establishes connection to a remote repo

7. git push origin master
pushed committed code to above repo under master branch

8.git clone <repositoryURL>
git clone command used to get code from repository for first time. Later on , pull command can be used so that only updated code can be fetched

9.git pull origin master
to pull from origin master

10. git status
gives the status of current branch

11. git branch
specifies in which branch we are in currently

12.git remote rm origin
to remove if origin already exists

13.git checkout -b jan12branch
to create branch named jan12branch and switch to that branch

once you create your branch
make your changes
add *
commit code
git push origin <createdbranchname> (jan12branch in this case)

so , new branch will be created in repo with committed changes

if anyone wants to take code from this created branch

14.git pull origin jan12branch
to pull from branch named jan12branch

once you pulled code from jan12branch and try to add changes in same branch , u need to switch to jan12branch

15.git checkout jan12branch
to switch from current branch to branch named jan12branch

make your changes
add *
commit code
git push origin <createdbranchname> (jan12branch in this case)

so till , here jan12branch has updated code
to merge code of jan12branch to master , first switch to master , take latest from master and then merge jan12branch to master

16.git checkout master
to switch from current /active branch to master

17 git pull origin master
do this every time you switch to master and try to merge a branch to master

18.git merge jan12branch
to merge branch named jan12branch to your active branch (master in this case) 

when ever you create new branch , copy of master will be given to created branch

if we make change in one line ,such that it differs from that of master branch in same line and commited code and tried to merge master again to our created branch
(there can be lines of code additional to that of master , but difference in same lines results in merge conflicts)

we will get merge conflicts

So make changes such that there in diff in lines of code when compared to master and commit again

19.git merge master
to merge master branch to our active branch
